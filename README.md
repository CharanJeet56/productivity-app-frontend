I want to create a salesforce app named "CCD Management" which will manage my life

1) The App should have a sections for "Financial Council"
    where i will update my monthly salary details every month end, i will update my expenses there and will track expenses analytically very well.

Expenses greater than 100 rs should be sent to someone as approver with note, Approver will approve and release amount whenever i want to spend something > 100
It should track my EMI, how much i gave pocket money to bro/sis, how many debts covered,
this should be sent as email every week and should be visible in section.

2) A Section "Zioto" which is my personal twitter
3) A Section "Deliverables", where at every month end week ill get email to fill next month deliverables in this section
4) A Section "CLothes Management" where i will upload my cloth details, so system will suggest best round robin where i dont repeat my clothes as circle as much long as it can
5) for all the sections i neeed internal AI for sugeestions if possible
